# Tips

Deploy a local blockchain akin to Ganache with ``npx hardhat node`` or ``hh node`` : https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/

To see a NFT in metamask, add the NFT contract address as a token with a precision of 0.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
